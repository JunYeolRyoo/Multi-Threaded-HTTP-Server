# Multi-Threaded-HTTP-Server

## Overview:
In this project, a multi-threaded server using a thread pool was created to enhance a single-threaded HTTP server. This enhancement enables the server to handle multiple client connections concurrently, simulating the behavior of real-world web servers. Additionally, the project ensures thread safety, synchronization, and a clean shutdown mechanism for the server.
